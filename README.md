# Data Science and Visualization Application

An Application for Data Science and Visualization made by students of the Master of Automation and IT program. 

The application gives users a hands-on, user-friendly experience with data and includes a wide range of features like data manipulation, regression and classification, usingÂ artificial intelligence and machine learning.

To improve the application's usability, the user is given textual details about the methods being used, suggestions and tooltips for different user inputs, and graphical outputs.
